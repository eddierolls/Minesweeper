# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game, hopefully to eventually write some kind of AI for

Simply run `python game.py` to play!

TODO list:
* Create a mechanism to collect and save down game boards collected from the random strategy
* Train a neural net on this to try to predict probability of a mine
* Train a better neural net to maximise win probability
* Create a tool to interrupt human play when they're about to make a suboptimal move
