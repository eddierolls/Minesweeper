Minesweeper game, hopefully to eventually write some kind of AI for

Simply run `python game.py` to play!

TODO list:
* Write unit tests for `game.py` and `player.py`
* Write a strategy to make random moves
* Create a mechanism to collect and save down game boards collected from the random strategy
* Train a neural net on this
